## ðŸ§© MCP and Copilot Setup

Once you have **Node.js** and **VS Code** installed, navigate to the [Playwright MCP GitHub page](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp?tab=readme-ov-file).

Scroll down to find the following section:

Click on **Install Server VS Code**:

![Install Button](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e622490-d3fb-427e-8c81-0aeb9cd1d955)

You will be prompted to open VS Code. Choose the installation location as needed, but installing to user settings is recommended:

![Install Options](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce5f883f-4180-4551-b4d0-713c4cc9e6b5)

After installation, you should see a `settings.json` file like this:

If you cannot find it, follow these steps:

---

Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open the command palette and search for:


![List Servers](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9abc511-a110-4071-8ce1-3bb81eca3b56)

Click it, and then select **Show Configuration** to open the server settings:

![Show Config](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6fb3f6f-a452-4b07-aa22-dcb61f2d24a1)

Once open, click the **Start** button to start the server:

![Start Server](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22f3eccb-1ce9-40f2-ac8b-e136337d05f7)

When the server is running, open **Copilot** in VS Code. Change the mode from **Ask** to **Agent**, then click on **Configure Tools**:

![Copilot Agent Mode](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6192dab0-d9ab-4cf9-99e1-139664ea4e0b)

You should now see all Playwright-related functionality:

![Playwright Tools](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a83d82c-be29-4ff4-a1a9-2da8d5ce3ce0)

As long as the server is running, you can now generate Playwright scripts using Copilot after installing Playwright in your project.
